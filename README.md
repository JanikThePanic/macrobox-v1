## 3D Print
Parts to 3D Print:
* x1 MB_Main_Case.SLDPRT
* x1 MB_Lower_Plate.SLDPRT
* x1 MB_LED_Spacer.SLDPRT

## CAD
The CAD is made in SolidWorks. If you need STLs, feel free to contact me.

## Code
The plan was to flash the chip with the Arduino Micro Firmware and program it in Arduino, with help from the Keyboard Library.
Unfortunately, I never got to that as I began working on a cheaper version, the MacroBox v2.

## Price Estimate
This is assuming the prints, screws, and resistors are free.

Total Estimate (CAD): 67.16
